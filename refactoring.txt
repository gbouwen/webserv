What is int index value used for with the handler class?

-> Only in run function fd_set _readFDS & _writeFDS ect. are used, could make this local variable
    + simplifies server struct
    + pas arguments when needed
    + create functions for FD_SET functions to avoid multiple if else statements

-> TCP connections can be moved from server.hpp to webserver.hpp.
    + variables hold now relation to server struct
    + only accessed on webserver level so using the variables becomes easier.

-> Create helper class or add cpp files to helper class to group generic functions and pass references to these functions to be able to change values if needed.
    + classes become easier to read
    + If it's a friend class it can access all values needed

->  Make a local response class which can be cleared after the usage of that function
    + shrinks header_handler function which data that's only needed in one function
    + only needed in send response function
